**Integration Testing Steps:**

1. Ensure that you have modified the `.env` file.
2. Change `http.js` to use your public IPv4 address (if you are testing on your machine, it should be set to `localhost`).
3. Run the Strapi app.
4. Complete the registration process.
5. Access the Strapi Admin Panel:

   - Go to your Strapi admin panel (usually at `http://<your-ip-address>:1337/admin`).
   - Navigate to the **Roles** section:
     - Go to **Settings**.
     - Click on **Users & Permissions Plugin**.
     - Select **Roles**.
   
6. Edit the Role:
   - Select the role that your request is using (e.g., Public or Authenticated).
   - Ensure that the role has permission to create entries for your pet collection type. Look for permissions related to the **create** action for the pets model.
